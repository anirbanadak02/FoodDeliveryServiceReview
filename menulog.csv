Restaurants not accepting orders from Menulog, then giving an expected time and waiting for 2 hours until the restaurant is closed. Multiple phone calls for each order to check where the order is at when the order is not accepted. There should be a better system to blacklist those restaurants who are not accepting orders on purpose. I ordered Nandos from Menulog and after 15 minutes I called Menulog why they haven’t accepted.

A few weeks ago I recommended my family order from The Cinnamon Kitchen at O'Halloran Hill. Everytime I ordered from here, it was great. But this night after spending $80, I got small servings for a value pack for 4 people. After questioning them, Menulog told me someone would get back to me. Unfortunately, no-one did. I called several times with the same message that was told someone will be in touch. Basically, if you pay for something, you except it and no less.

When attempting to contact menulog through either either the chat function on the app or via phone, the response time is extremely slow. On one occasion I was offered a $10 coupon. This final order I was simply offered the option to cancel my order as the delivery time was estimated to be 50 minutes later than originally stated. With so many other competitors out there in this market, there is absolutely no reason to use menulog in the future. Go with another service provider or get in touch with the restaurant directly.",Negative

Shaun and Jane,https://www.productreview.com.au/consumer-profiles/439a0f18-22a8-4163-8430-35102c6a7a25,The experience of using Menulog is good as long as their driver delivers...Our driver delivered to the wrong address tonight so we contacted the customer service for a refund with our empty stomach...We had a similar experience from Uber Eats and the refund was done in a blink without needing to talk to someone. However Menulog Customer Service could only forward our case to other team and then the team got back to us after 2 days. I was giving 1 star review to their online customer service but I edited the review now since we got our refund back. They will offer either 100% cash refund back or extra credit to order from Menulog again. The result after all is not that bad.,Positive

I said ""Why are you not able to refund me in full for something I paid for and never received?"" She then reluctantly agrees to refund me the full amount.
