When they are incapable of training their riders to complete jobs to a set standard, issues will inevitably arise and arise very often. In fact, do they vet and train their drivers at all? Really. The issue is simple: Get a good driver, get the job done properly. Get a bad driver, get a terrible experience. It has happened time and time and time again——-the standards set for food delivery is simply too low and there will never be an end to poor food delivery service until one of them invest in obtaining drivers better prepared for excellent service.
